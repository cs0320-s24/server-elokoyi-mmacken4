HIGH LEVEL EXPLANATION
We have a csv package that handles all of the actual csv parsing logic. WIthin the csv folderm there
is a CSVParser class that handles the parsing logic, a Search calss that handles the search and sorting logic,
a CreatorFromRow interface that defines a method that allows your CSV parser to convert each row into
an object of some arbitrary passed type.

Then there is the datasource package that has the ACS folder which has the ACS class, which has the
state,county, and broadband information structure. Then the ACSAPIUtilities class handles the logic of
information being passed between the server and converted into usable data.

The endpoints include the LoadCSV, ViewCSV, SearchCSV, and Broaadband Handler.
